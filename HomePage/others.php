        <h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>
        This page will briefly introduce you to some projects that I have worked on (or I am currently working on) for co-op, school, or personal use.
        </p><br/>

        	<h2>Co-op experience at Caffeinated Trutle</h2>
            <p>
            I worked at <a href="http://www.caffeinatedturtle.ca/" target="_blank">Caffeinated Turtle Enterprice</a> as a co-op student for 8 months. My duties were mainly a continuation of the <a href="http://www.nuance.com/landing-pages/products/voiceads/" target="_blank">Nuance Voice Ad (NVA) </a> project which is a ground breaking advertising system that utilizes mobile phones and its voice activity features such as recording and playing of sounds. Using those features, NVA allows the advertisements displayed on the mobile phone  to interact with the user by recording and recognizing vocal expressions and replying with a catered response. Using this technology enhances the user’s experience by making them feel as if they are having a conversation with the advertisement.

          	<h2>Interdisciplinary Study</h2>
            <p>
People often ask me how Psychology can be related to Computer Science. To be honest in the beginning of my degree, I could not find a strong connection between these two different fields. But as I progressed further into my studies, I can now see the clear connection in Computer Science and Psychology which I believe can make all technology more powerful: designing an intuitive and user-centered user interface. 
This interdisciplinary study program at UVic allowed me to research into those two different flavors under a professor's direction. In my studies, I am investigating effective visualizations of daily physical activity data of users collected from mobile phones. These visualizations facilitate the user to be aware of their activity level and to motivate themselves to become more physically active and healthy. 

I am still in the process of implementing this visualization application but I will keep you posted about my research here.

    <h2>Big data analysis</h2>
        <p>
    In one of my courses that I am currently taking, I and other team members are investigating the hidden values in big data (specifically in social networking data). In our first project we looked at the tweet data to extract health related tweets, which we later analyzed and visualized their occurrences to a geographical visualization.
<a href="http://www.erikafable.com/projects/healthytweets/healthytweets.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the website link that sums up our project.

We well continue to investigate this topic and eventually provide a platform that allows people to look up interesting words in real-time and allows them to associate the words with tweeted regions.
